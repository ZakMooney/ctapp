      <h2>Cucumber Architecture</h2>
      <p>The Cucumber platform is built within Google Compute Engine (GCE). The service is formed of over 2 dozen micro-services that provide high-availability, redundancy and performance.</p>

      <p>The network is distributed globally, with data centres in the EU, US and Asia.</p>

      <p>We utilise a number of Google's tools to boost performance, including BigQuery for data warehousing and PUBSUB for high-performance queues.</p>

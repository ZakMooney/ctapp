          <p>Cucumber Tony is the first WiFi platform with a fully featured public RESTful API. Build your own applications on top, or offer this as an extra service to your clients.</p>
          <p>Unlike typical vendor deployment which adhere to 3-6 month release cycles, Cucumber Tony releases fixes and upgrades daily. We treat WiFi as software, increasing the reliability whilst reducing release times.</p>
          <p>Setting up and shipping your devices is a breeze. You can provision custom configs per customer or groups of customers.</p>
          <p>Upload your own firmware to the management platform and deploy it automatically to your customers.</p>

          <p>Cucumber Tony is yours to enjoy, brand, and redesign. We provide all the tools to get started. The entire front-end can be completely re-branded to match yours. The simple, modular design lets you add or remove customer components.</p>
          <p>The interface can be hosted by Cucumber Tony or as part of your own deploy cycle.</p>

      <div class="mdl-grid">

          <p>The system is defined by three parts:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The front-end interface - the dashboard</li>
            <li>The back-end platform that controls the devices</li>
            <li>The daemon that runs on the devices providing secure communication</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The process is simple. We provide a simple daemon that you install on your firmware. This communicates with Cucumber Tony, providing a bi-directional, secure way to communicate with your access points.</p>
          <p>Access points provision automatically and reconfigure themselves directly.</p>

          <h3>CT WiFi announced winners of TechWeek NYC’s LAUNCH startup competition</h3>

          <p>Oh what a week it’s been! Big Chief Simon Morley was at TechWeek NYC’s LAUNCH competition, and needless to say, we are over the moon to be walking away the winner.</p>
          <p>TechWeek’s annual LAUNCH competition for startups aims to identify and celebrate tech entrepreneurs, with 750+ businesses applying from around the world for the chance to demo and pitch to judges and investors.</p>
          <p>CT WiFi was shortlisted along with 40 other businesses for a chance to exhibit at New York’s LAUNCH city finals. In the natural CT WiFi fashion, we wanted to stand out and do something extraordinary.</p>
          <p>The week started off with brainstorming and making wooden fork business cards. All that was missing were the cucumbers of course!</p>

          <p>The cucumber treats went down a storm! Everyone wanted a treat. After 6 hours of sandwiches, t-shirts, and non-stop Q&As of the CT WiFi platform; it was confirmed that we were down to the final 5 — presentation time.</p>
          <p>Simon took the stage and dazzled the judges with his CT WiFi presentation. At the end of the day, we were announced winner of Techweek NYC Launch! What a day!</p>

          <p>Thanks Techweek for this amazing opportunity and experience. We had such a great time meeting all of you there. A hop, a skip, a trek across New York, and a plane ride later; it’s good to know the winning trophy has arrived safely at CT’s headquarters in London to a happy cheering team.</p>

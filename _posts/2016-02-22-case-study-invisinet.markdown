  	<h1>How Invisinet Use Cucumber</h1>
		<p>Rob from Invisnet tells us how he uses Cucumber and why?</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>Hi Rob, so who are Invisinet?</h2>

		<p>Invisinet are a specialist Wi-Fi networking company who design and manage business Wi-Fi hotspots and full scale home networks.</p>

		<p>They use Cucumber Tony [CT] to manage their clientWi-Fi networks and build on the social media marketing services they also offer.</p>

		<h2>Why Cucumber?</h2>

		<p>I’d say flexibility. CT let’s us design, code and install customised Wi-Fi systems to any customer specification. Our project managers can provide whatever the customer wants from their Wi-Fi which makes everyone happy.</p>

		<p>In comparison to other marketing initiatives Wi-Fi is an affordable option to for our clients. Branding is a must. Client’s want the whole system branded to their business. Wi-Fi with someone else’s name on isn’t going to give them anything back. They want to take full advantage of the opportunity Wi-Fi gives them to engage with their customers.</p>

		<p>The Cucumber platform lets us turn around beautiful tailored branding quickly for our clients. Once this is set up and user data like demographics begins to be captured we help businesses gain the most value they can from their network and use this data to their advantage.</p>

		<h2>What do you love about Cucumber?</h2>

		<p>The platform allows us to constantly evolve with our clients’ needs. We can update splash pages and networks remotely and turn around new designs as and when a client needs.</p>

		<h3>“Without Cucumber we wouldn’t be able to offer our tailored marketing solutions to our customers.”</h3>
		</div>

		<p>A client may be very focused on direct marketing and keen to let customers know that they are running a special offer on a certain day or very keen to increase footfall at their sister store. Cucumber lets us tailor the splash page and direct marketing emails to do this.</p>

		<p>Another client may be very keen to improve their social media engagement. Rather than just having a customer sign in to the Wi-Fi through their Facebook account (which many people are reluctant to do, they redirect them to their Facebook page. Once they’re there we can offer them engaging content. This gives the business meaningful online interaction.</p>

		<p>Without Cucumber we wouldn’t be able to offer these tailored marketing solution to our customers. It’s an extra channel for the marketing initatives we run for clients.</p>

		<p>By tracking the number of repeat users and the average length of time a customer spends in store we can show our clients the value in their Wi-Fi network and marketing strategy and where things could be improved. In this way the Wi-Fi set up and campaigns are constantly evolving and improving.</p>

		<h2>Do you have an example of how Cucumber has made a difference?</h2>

		<p>Definitely. One of our clients is an independent coffee shop that was struggling to afford expensive newspaper adverts. After we installed their hotspot they saw their Facebook likes rise by over 50% in one month. They also recorded 400 emails to add to their monthly newsletter which they knew would go to new people who had visited the store. Sales of the special went up 25% after in was promoted on the splash page.</p>

		<h2>At what point did you know Cucumber was right for you?</h2>

		<p>As soon as we met with the CT team and trialled the system we knew it was an ideal fit for our clients. It enables us to access data and analyse the performance of the technology we are installing. It integrates with the hardware we already use and the online support team and remote access platform enables us to work nationwide.</p>

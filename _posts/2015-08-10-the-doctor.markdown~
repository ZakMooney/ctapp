First off, connect to the Access Point via either it's private network, directly through a cable, or over your WAN using your box's IP (you will not be able to access any of the local portal on the public WiFi)

Then enter the following into your browser's address bar: polka.box/doctor

If this doesn't work, enter the local IP of your box and add /doctor to the end.

If you aren't already logged in, it will prompt you for a username and password. 

The username for the local portal is currently always polkaspots.

Your password is the serial number of the box that you are trying to connect to, which you can locate through Cucumber Tony on the box's information page.

The doctor page should load and immediately begin running it's checks, which can take a few minutes.

Test results will begin to populate on screen, and once finished a green download button will appear at the bottom.

This will save all the information into a small text file, so it can be passed on to the Support Team for diagnosis.

To run the script, follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Connect to the Access Point via either it's private network, directly through a cable, or over your WAN using your box's IP (you will not be able to access any of the local portal on the public WiFi)</li>

<li>Enter the following into your browser's address bar: polka.box/doctor. <br> If this doesn't work, enter the local IP of your box and add /doctor to the end.</li>

<li>If you aren't already logged in, it will prompt you for a username and password.<br>
- The username for the local portal is currently always polkaspots.<br>
- Your password is the serial number of the box that you are trying to connect to, which you can locate through Cucumber Tony on the box's information page.</li>

<li>The doctor page should load and immediately begin running it's checks, which can take a few minutes.</li>

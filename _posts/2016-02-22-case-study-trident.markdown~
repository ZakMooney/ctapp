  	<h1>How Trident Group Use Cucumber</h1>
		<p>Trident have a Ruckus Virtual Smart Zone network and use Cucumber to manage it. David tells us why they use Cucumber alongside their Ruckus vSZ.</p>

		<h2>Hi David, so who are Trident?</h2>

		<p>We’re a professional infrastructure company. We provide managed services to all kinds of businesses. Wi-Fi management is one of the services we offer.</p>

		<h2>What do you use Cucumber for?</h2>

		<p>We have a big Ruckus network which we run using the Virtual Smart Zone (vSZ). We use the Cucumber management interface to monitor and control the vSZ and the offer clients captive portal solutions. A lot of our clients are hospitality based and need a splash page and captive portal.</p>

		<p>We manage the whole Wi-Fi solution for them, the captive portal is just part of the offering. Cucumber means we can offer a great monitoring and management service.</p>

		<p>Having a Cucumber dashboard means we can manage different vendor access points. We’re looking at some APs we can install the Cucumber Tony firmware on. The Ubiquity UniFi for example would suit some clients on a lower budget who don’t need high end kit like Ruckus or Meraki. This way we could offer clients a bigger range of solutions and one to match any budget.</p>

		<h2>What were you looking to solve with Cucumber?</h2>

		<p>We originally thought the vSZ had a captive portal solution, so when we found out it didn’t we looked for a third party option. It was too labour intensive to create and maintain one ourselves.</p>

		<p>We looked around the market, our Ruckus distributor recommended we try Purple Wi-Fi, but it was expensive and the tech wasn’t quite there. Cucumber was the best on price and tech.</p>

		<p>When we first got in touch the guys at Cucumber were so friendly — it was a breath of fresh air how they dealt with our set up. We could speak to the techies directly and they’d set things up and changed configs for us there and then.</p>

		<h2>Do you have a favourite feature?</h2>

		<p>One of our favourite things is the easy interface. The Ruckus interface is complex and the Cucumber dashboard helps improve this experience. We’re looking forward to getting more control out of this.</p>

		<p>What we really love though is the Cucumber team. Their support has been great. It’s important for us to be able to speak to someone who knows the product inside out — someone we know and trust to sort things out. We’re servicing clients so if we need help we can’t wait days for a response.</p>

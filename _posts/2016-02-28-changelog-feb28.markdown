**Splash Page Timeout**

You can now set a timeout for your splash pages when using timed access. 

This allows you to control the amount of time before the splash is seen again. For example, you set up two splash pages - clickthrough and vouchers. You want the clickthrough to appear for 2 hours per day. After which they need to use a voucher code.

Set the timeout on the clickthrough splash to 90 days and, after their two hours has been used, they will only see the voucher page.

**Login Page Triggers**

You can now trigger an event when someone logs in

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed the redirect URL that wasn't saving previously
- Fixed the blank error message on the login pages

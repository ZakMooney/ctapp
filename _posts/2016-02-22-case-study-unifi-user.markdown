<h1>Using Cucumber To Manage UniFi</h1>
<p>We asked one avid user why he uses Cucumber to manage his Ubiquiti UniFi network. He asked that he remained anonymous to avoid revealing any information to his competition. He said: </p>

<div class="mdl-typography--text-center">
<h3>“...if my competition got hold of Cucumber Wi-Fi I’d loose my edge — it’s saves me hours of time, I don’t want them getting their hands on it.”</h3>

<h2>What does your business use Cucumber for?</h2>

<p>We’re an MSP (managed service provider). We have a network of around 40 UniFi APs installed in different customer sites. We do the whole bundle for them, POS, VoIP phones, PCs etc...</p>

<h2>Why do you use Cucumber?</h2>

<p>We use Cucumber to manage all our UniFi APs. We used to run the UniFi software in an Amazon cloud server. Maintaining the network was a pain and we didn’t have much control. I had to click into each access point individually to see which one was online. With Cucumber I can see in a glance what’s happening.</p>

<h2>What problem does Cucumber fix for you?</h2>

<p>To start we wanted a captive portal with splash pages to sell to our clients. Cucumber has them so we started using these. Then we realised how much easier it was to run the Wi-Fi using the dashboard so we now use it daily to run our networks.</p>

<h2>Anything else you’d like to add?</h2>

<p>The extra functionality has really changed how we run the Wi-Fi networks in the office. We’re always talking about how great Cucumber Tony is — seriously.</p>

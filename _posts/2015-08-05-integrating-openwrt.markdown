You can use the Cucumber Tony dashboard, splash pages and radius servers including our Facebook logins with your OpenWRT, DD-WRT, OpenMesh and other boxes.

To begin with, head over to your location in Cucumber Tony and add your box into CT using the <b>I have a Meraki, Ruckus or other device</b> option.

Once this is added, open your boxâ€™s page and you will see a large button titled <b>Radius Settings</b>.

<div class="mdl-typography--text-center">

</div>

You will be shown a page with all the radius settings information needed. You will be using this as reference for information used in configuring your box.

Your <b>UAM URL</b> is a mix of the <b>Splash URL</b> shown in the Radius Settings, and your <b>location ID</b>, which can be found in your location settings..

Your <b>UAM secret</b> is tied to the individual splash pages, and so it is not displayed here.

To find your <b>UAM secret</b>, head over to <b>SSIDs</b> from your location, by clicking it on the left sidebar, and then click <b>View</b> on an SSID you have set up.

Once here, scroll down to <b>Advanced Settings</b> under the <b>Captive Portal</b> section, and <b>untick Use Cucumber Tony Splash</b>. This will make a field appear with your UAM Secret inside.

<i>[<b>Note:</b> You do not need to save this change, you are only unticking it temporarily so you can see the UAM Secret.]</i>

<h3>Attention OpenMesh Users</h3>

You will need to split the UAM urls to use with the OpenMesh network.

Instead of entering <b>http://app.my-wifi.co/123456890</b> as your UAM URL, do the following:

<b>UAM Server:</b>  http://app.my-wifi.co/

<b>UAM URL:</b>  LocationID/

Make sure you replace the id with your ID and don't forget the / at the end. The Location ID is a long number.

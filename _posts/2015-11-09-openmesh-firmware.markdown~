You will need:

<ul>
<li>- A computer with ethernet ports</li>
<li>- An OpenMesh device</li>
<li>- 1 x Ethernet cables</li>
<li>- Access to the terminal on your PC</li>
<li>- A download of the Cucumber firmware</li>
<li>- A download of the ap51-flash flashing utility</li>
</ul>

<hr>

Let's get flashing...

1 - Download and build the ap51-flash flashing utility by running the following commands:

```
svn co http://dev.cloudtrax.com/downloads/svn/ap51-flash/trunk/ ap51-flash
cd ap51-flash
make
```

2 - Download the firmware needed by following <span data-elevio-article="13200">**this guide.**</span>

3 - Connect your Access Point onto the same physical network as your computer/laptop

4 - Use the ap51-flash utility built in step 1 above and run the following

```
./ap51-flash eth0 FIRMWARE_LOCATION.bin
```

Then plug in your OpenMesh box and power it up.

You should then see something similar to this in the console:

```
[MA:C-:AD:DR:ES:S ]: type 'OM2P router' detected
[MA:C-:AD:DR:ES:S ]: OM2P router: tftp client asks for 'fwupgrade.cfg', serving fwupgrade.cfg portion of: openwrt-ar71xx-generic-om2p-squashfs-factory.bin (1 blocks) ...
[MA:C-:AD:DR:ES:S ]: OM2P router: tftp client asks for 'kernel', serving kernel portion of: openwrt-ar71xx-generic-om2p-squashfs-factory.bin (1993 blocks) ...
[MA:C-:AD:DR:ES:S ]: OM2P router: tftp client asks for 'rootfs', serving rootfs portion of: openwrt-ar71xx-generic-om2p-squashfs-factory.bin (4609 blocks) ...
[MA:C-:AD:DR:ES:S ]: OM2P router: image successfully transmitted - writing image to flash ...
[MA:C-:AD:DR:ES:S ]: OM2P router: flash complete. Device ready to unplug.
```

5 - Then go ahead and add your box into your Cucumber Tony dashboard.

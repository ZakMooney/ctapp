Policy Groups allow you to define, on different networking levels, who can and cannot connect to your WiFi.

You can block/whitelist on the splash, network and firewall levels. This means that you have the freedom to choose where you apply the block/whitelist for a device.

Do you want them to see the splash page but not be allowed to sign in, or do you want them to not have to bother with the splash at all but still get internet access?

Do you want to let someone connect to your SSID but prevent their internet access, or do you want the prevent them from connecting to the SSID altogether?

The choice is yours.

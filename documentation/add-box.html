    <h1>Add Your Access Point<br></h1>
    <hr>
		<p>Adding a new box to your location is a very simple process, just follow these quick steps:</p>
		<div class="documentation img">

		</div>
		<ol>
		<li>Select the <strong>location</strong> you want to add a new box to.</li>
		<li>Click on <strong>Boxes</strong> in the left hand side bar</li>
		<li>Click on the <strong>New box</strong> button.</li>
		<li>You will be presented a number of options to help you decide how best to add your box into Cucumber Tony. Tick one of the boxes, and then click on next. Your choices are as follows:</li>
		<hr>
		<p><strong>I have a Cucumber Tony box</strong></p>
		<p>This is the option for you if you either bought a box with preloaded firmware from us, or if you already have a box with our firmware installed.</p>
		<p>Clicking this option will allow you to use the auto detect feature.</p>
		<p>However, if you do not have an internet connection to the Access Point at that time, or other such issues, you will not be able to use the autodetect feature, but you will be able to manually add your box’s mac address</p>
		<hr>
		<p><strong>I want to install the firmware</strong></p>
		<p>This is the option for you if you have a supported box and want to get it running Stinky Panda.</p>
		<p>Clicking this option will take you to the firmware download page where you can retrieve the firmware to flash onto your Access Point.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><strong>I have an order number or mac address</strong></p>
		<p>This is the option for you if you have the mac address or Order ID ready with you, as you can use both of these to add the box into Cucumber Tony.</p>
		<p>Clicking on this option will open two fields for you, one for the mac address and one for the Order ID, either of which can be submitted to add it to your location.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><strong>I have a Meraki, Ruckus or other device</strong></p>
		<p>If you are trying to add a different third party device, then please make use of this option.</p>
		<p>Clicking on this option will open two fields for you, one for the mac address and one for the Order ID, either of which can be submitted to add it to your location. It will also list the box as a non-polkaspots box.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><strong>I don't have a box yet</strong></p>
		<p>If you don’t currently have a box for yourself that is compatible, then clicking this option will take you to the store where you can purchase all of the Access Points you want.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><i>Once you have your basic configuration set up and your boxes added, you can move on to tweaking it exactly how you want and trying out some more advanced features/configurations.</i><p>
